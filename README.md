Drawing with JavaScript in HTML5 vs ActionScript 3 in Flash
===========================================================

This repository is a copy of William Malone's 
(http://www.williammalone.com/) HTML 5
canvas and Flash drawing comparison.

The original article can be found here:

This repository mostly functions as a personal references, but I also hope that
is encourages people to move away from Flash as a web development platform.
